# Formaldehyde
NK/LK lightweight interactive proof assistant

## Requirements

An OCaml distribution (v4.x or whatever) including `ocamllex` and `ocamlyacc` (for parser generation), with `OCamlMakeFile` in your `make` path (or simply a copy of it into the Formaldehyde directory) to be able to compile using the provided `Makefile`.

**NB:** Formaldehyde uses the `Unix` OCaml standard module to detect whether the input is a terminal or a redirection. According to the OCaml documentation, this should be correctly emulated under Windows (however, this was not tested).

Compiling:
```
$ make
```

## Contents

### Implemented features
- Full NK sequent-based (*Ã  la* Gentzen) proof system
- Proof tree export to LaTeX

### ToDo list
- Fix the current parser priorities that are not standard
- Fix the parentheses printing (currently incomplete, and should be implemented in accordance to the parser priorities)
- LK proof system
- Basic automatic proof search algorithm

### On proof tree export to LaTeX

There are many LaTeX packages that provide macros to build proof trees. Formaldehyde currently uses the rather classical LaTeX package `proof` (simple and classical recursive syntax, nice aesthetics, after having considered the slightly less satisfactory `mathpartir` package).

For a somehow more "modern" approach, one could also consider more recent packages such as `bussproofs` or `ebproofs` that provide a *stack-based* syntax (or *reverse Polish* style).

## Syntax
